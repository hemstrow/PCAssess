#'Deschutes stickleback example snpRdata.
#'
#'A dataset containing genotypes at 100 SNP loci for 100 Three-spined
#'Stickleback collected in 2015 from several locations in the Deschutes River,
#'Oregon, USA. For more information, see Hemstrom et al (in prep).
#'
#'Stored in the snpRdata object class. See \code{\link{import.snpR.data}} for
#'details.
#'
#'Genotypes noted as two characters representing bases sequenced at a specific
#'site (e.g. "CC" or "GT"). Each SNP occupies one row, each sample occupies on
#'column. Missing data coded as "NN".
#'
#'Sample and snp metadata can be found in the sample.meta and snp.meta sockets,
#'respectively.
